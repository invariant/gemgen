gemgen - Markdown to Gemtext
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBgemgen [-e] [-i input.\&md] [-o output.\&gmi]\fR
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBgemgen\fR is a tool for converting Commonmark Markdown to Gemtext.\& Gemgen uses
the goldmark markdown parser and my gemtext rendering module.\&
.P
The goal is to create proper hand-made gemtext.\& Links and autolinks are
placed below each paragraph, but a paragraph of only links is left intact.\&
Normally, paragraphs are merged onto a single line, but hardlinks (double
spaces or  at the end of a line) may be used for manual line breaks.\& Lists and
headings are simplified to the gemtext format, emphasis markings are removed
(or kept with the -e flag), horizontal rules are turned into 80 character
lines, and indented code is converted to the gemtext fenced format.\&
